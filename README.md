> It is quite a fuss for a developer or security tester to perform an analysis of your domain's attack surface and dangerous ports. Especially, if you do not have access to the required tools. The ultimate goal of this program is to solve this problem providing an automated tool; **running multiple scanning tools to discover vulnerabilities, effectively judge false-positives, collectively correlate results** and **saves precious time**; all these under one roof.<p>Enter **Ceziam**.

## Features
- **one-step security check**.
- **dangerous port check** 
- **attack surface check by enumaerating subdomains**  
- **displays the results spontaneously**
- **Future versions will include API security verification and WebApplication OWASP top10 checks**
- saves a lot of time, **indeed a lot time!**
